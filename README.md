# Financial Planning App

The purpose of this app is to allow the user to create accounts that they hold money in and then add or remove transactions (deposits and withdrawals) to the account balance as needed. Doing so the balance of the account will change to balance thus allowing the user to keep a record of thier spending and take the first step toward financial understanding and budgetting.

In order to use this app you will need the frontend that was created for it. That can be accessed here: https://github.com/AaronJHarvey/financial-frontend
